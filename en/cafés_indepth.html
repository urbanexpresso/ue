                We manage an exclusive catalogue of paintings by young artists.

              <li>
                The catalogue is only available to café-managers. If there's a
                painting that you want to have in your café, you can order it
                completely for free.

                Via QR-Code, your customers can text the artist an offer to buy
                the painting. The artist can either accept or deny the offer. If
                the artist agrees, you will receive 10% of the total amount,
                while 80% goes to the artist and 10% goes to us for logistics.

                We will inform you about the new owner's initials, who can then
                pick up the painting at your café by presenting his/her ID for
                confirmation.
